(3) the sequence number -- your implementation needs to:

count sequence number in bytes; ACK each packet

(4) connection management

your server code initiates connection termination

your server needs to remain working to accept new connection from the client if the previous connection has been torn down

your server code does not need to support *simultaneous* connections

(5) timer accuracy

your implementation should make sure that the RTO timer/TIME WAIT follows *roughly* the designated values.



The above guidelines are not meant to serve as the real testing procedures or rubrics.

However, meeting all these guidelines is a strong indicator that your implementation  covers most test cases for Project 2.

We will post the demo appointment confirmation by Wednesday noon time.
